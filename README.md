# Lilypond Liturgy

Related to my other project [Ecclesiastical Chants](https://github.com/BallsyWalnuts/ecclesiastical-chants), but whereas that project focuses on engraving in Gregorian Chant notation using LaTeX, this project focuses on creating liturgical resources using [LilyPond](https://lilypond.org/).

***But LilyPond supports Gregorian Chant notation!***

Yes, I have discovered this. I am still going to keep the projects separate for the time being for a couple reasons:

- I still want to learn LaTeX, and the other project will be helpful in that
- Right now I want to keep ancient notation and modern music notation projects separate. 

I may merge the projects at some point in the future, but who knows?
